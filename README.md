### Project Overview

SQL analysis refers to using SQL (Structured Query Language) to access, retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases. It is a powerful tool for data analysts to query large datasets directly where they reside, enabling efficient data exploration, aggregation (such as sums, counts, averages), filtering, and joining of multiple tables to uncover insights. SQL supports various functions for mathematical, statistical, and time-series analysis, making it essential for cleaning, transforming, and summarizing data in preparation for deeper analysis or reporting.
